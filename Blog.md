**Spring 2023**

**April 3, 1450:**


All class announcements from this point onward will be made here in this
blog, rather than by mass e-mail.  When making a blog post, I will also
try to send a message notifying you of a new post, but may not always do
so.  You are required to read the blog at least once per day.
